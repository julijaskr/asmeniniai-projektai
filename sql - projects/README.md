# SQL Projects

Hello and welcome!  
In this section of my GitHub profile, I’m sharing my personal SQL-based data analysis projects.  
These projects are built using open datasets from sources such as Kaggle, Northwind, and Open Data Portals.

Each project is independently developed and reflects my approach to exploring business questions through SQL queries, data transformation, and insight generation.
