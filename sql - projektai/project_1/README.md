# ðŸ“Š Northwind SQL Analysis Project

This project showcases an exploratory SQL analysis using the classic **Northwind** database. The goal was to gain insights into company sales, customer behavior, product performance, and discount impact using structured queries and aggregations.

## Dataset

The project is based on the **Northwind** database, a fictional company that imports and exports specialty foods. It includes key business entities like:
- `orders`
- `order_details`
- `customers`
- `products`

## Tools Used

- MySQL / SQL Workbench
- SQL queries only (no visualizations included in this project)

## Project Goals

- Practice SQL skills with real-world-style business questions
- Explore sales performance over time, by customer, product, and region
- Calculate financial impact of discounts
- Analyze shipping destinations and product categories

## Project Structure

The analysis is divided into six main sections:

### 1. Sales Analysis by Time
- Monthly order volume and revenue trends
- Total quantities and discounts applied
- Sales amounts calculated per order with discounts

### 2. Sales Analysis by Product
- Identify top-performing products
- Total sales per product
- Discount impact per item

### 3. Customer Analysis
- Top customers by revenue
- Customer purchases over time
- Sales distribution by country

### 4. Discount Impact Analysis
- Grouping sales by discount ranges
- Identifying how discounts affect order volume and revenue

### 5. Delivery Analysis
- Most common shipping countries
- Sales volume and order count by delivery location

### 6. Product Category Analysis
- Performance comparison between product categories
- Total units sold and revenue per category

## Key Learnings

- Advanced use of `JOIN`s and aggregate functions
- Grouping data by time periods (e.g. month/year)
- Use of `CASE` statements to categorize data
- Writing clear and business-relevant queries

## Next Steps

- Create Power BI visualizations using SQL output
- Expand analysis to include employee performance
- Explore customer segmentation or cohort analysis
